\usepackage{pdfpages} %% Embed pdfs


%%********************************************************************************
%% Embed pdfs (part 2) (OPTIONAL)
%%****************************************
%% TO USE: Manual actions are required. See instructions below
%% TO SKIP: No action required. Leave everything as is or comment it out

%% PURPOSE
%%      By using the package `pdfpages' to embed this pdf into the thesis, all the hyperlinks become no longer clickable.
%%      To reinsert the links, the package `pax' can be used

%% INSTRUCTIONS
%%      Stage 1 (only needs to be run once)
%%      Compile with LuaLaTeX
%%      Then Rename the output files from *.newpax to *.pax
%%      For me, some of the links were broken. Either delete them from the pax file, or manually fix them in the pax file
%%      Stage 2 (run on every compile)
%%      Compile with pdflatex as normal
%% Notes
%%      For stage 1, the file extension should not be included
%%      Stage 2 doesn't like the pdfs sitting in subfolders

%% (STAGE 1) Extract links
\usepackage{ifluatex,etoolbox}
\ifluatex
    \directlua{require("newpax")}
    \directlua{
        newpax.writenewpax("MyPublishedArticle1")
        newpax.writenewpax("MyPublishedArticle2")
    }
\fi

%% (STAGE 2) Insert links
%% newpax requires the package pdfmanagement-testphase
%% But this is not compatible with the pdfx package
%% => Using the output of nexpax with pax
%% The following is copied from the newpax documentation
\ifluatex
    \usepackage{pdftexcmds}
    \makeatletter
    \let\pdfstrcmp\pdf@strcmp
    \let\pdfescapename\pdf@escapename
    \makeatother
    \usepackage{luatex85}
