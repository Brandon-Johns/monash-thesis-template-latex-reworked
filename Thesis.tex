%% Using the class Thesis.cls, which is included with this template
%% Thesis.cls has been modified by many, based on the ECS Thesis style originally by Steve Gunn

%% Options:
%%  "oneside" - (default) for online version
%%  "twoside" - for printed/bound version
\documentclass[]{Thesis}

%% Font Choice
%\usepackage[lining]{nunito}


%%********************************************************************************
%% Embed pdfs (part 1)
%%****************************************
%% This is for thesis including published works. It allows to embed your published articles in the thesis
%%      For regular figures, which happen to be pdfs, you should use \includegraphics instead
\usepackage{pdfpages} %% Embed pdfs


%%********************************************************************************
%% Embed pdfs (part 2) (OPTIONAL)
%%****************************************
%% Warning: This section is somewhat advanced, and you may find it difficult to make it work.
%%      If you want to skip this, then no action is required - leave it or comment it out as you wish.
%%      To give it a go, see the instructions below

%% PURPOSE
%%      By using the package `pdfpages' to embed this pdf into the thesis, all the hyperlinks become no longer clickable.
%%      To reinsert the links, the package `pax' can be used

%% INSTRUCTIONS
%%      Stage 1 (only needs to be run once)
%%      Compile with LuaLaTeX
%%      Then Rename the output files from *.newpax to *.pax
%%      For me, some of the links were broken. Either delete them from the pax file, or manually fix them in the pax file
%%      Stage 2 (run on every compile)
%%      Compile with pdflatex as normal
%%      If there are errors, or the compiler hangs, check for any escaped characters in the URLs.
%%          These should instead be URL encoded. e.g.
%%          Change \( to %28
%%          Change \) to %29
%% Notes
%%      For stage 1, the file extension should not be included
%%      Stage 2 doesn't like the pdfs sitting in subfolders

%% (STAGE 1) Extract links
\usepackage{ifluatex,etoolbox}
\ifluatex
    \directlua{require("newpax")}
    \directlua{
        newpax.writenewpax("MyPublishedArticle1")
        newpax.writenewpax("MyPublishedArticle2")
    }
\fi

%% (STAGE 2) Insert links
%% newpax requires the package pdfmanagement-testphase
%% But this is not compatible with the pdfx package
%% => Using the output of newpax with pax
%% The following is copied from the newpax documentation
\ifluatex
    \usepackage{pdftexcmds}
    \makeatletter
    \let\pdfstrcmp\pdf@strcmp
    \let\pdfescapename\pdf@escapename
    \makeatother
    \usepackage{luatex85}
\fi
\usepackage{pax}
%% Correct a bug in pax affecting clipping
\makeatletter
\patchcmd\PAX@pdf@annot{\PAX@pagellx}{\PAX@page@llx}{}{\fail}
%% Allow hashes and percent in the pax file
\patchcmd\PAX@AddAnnots{\InputIfFileExists\PAX@file{}{\typeout{* Missing: \PAX@file}}}
{\begingroup \catcode`\#=12 \catcode`\%=12
\InputIfFileExists\PAX@file{}{\typeout{* Missing: \PAX@file}}\endgroup}{}{\fail}
\makeatother

%%****************************************
\usepackage{silence}
\WarningFilter{latex}{You have requested package `lib/nicematrix',} %% Using local as the latest version is not available on overleaf
\usepackage{lib/nicematrix} %% Tables, matrices, etc.

%% Bibliography
%%****************************************
\usepackage[style=numeric, sorting=none, isbn=false, url=true,sortcites=true,maxbibnames=99]{biblatex}
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\small}

%% Prevent paragraph break in bib https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/43275

%% Prevent "et al." in \fullcite https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/267089

%% ACTION: Include your references in the .bib file
\addbibresource{Bibliography/Bibliography.bib}


%%********************************************************************************
%% OPTIONAL: Add your own packages and commands here
%%****************************************
%% Note that many packages are included for you within Thesis.cls
%%    If you want to change their options, then I suggest doing so from where they currently are within the class file.
%%    Do not re-add them here.
%%    Small edits in the class file isn't too scary. Promise!
