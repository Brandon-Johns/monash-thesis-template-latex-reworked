%% The following embedded document represents your published article.
\includepdf[pages={-},pagecommand={},offset=0mm 10mm]{MyPublishedArticle1.pdf}

%% NOTE 1
%% The article is being embedded into an A4 document.
%% If the article is not A4, then it will be shrunk to fit and centred in the page.
%% The offset parameter can move from the default position
%% => If the thesis footer overlaps the included pdf, then try changing the scale and offset
%% e.g.
%% \includepdf[pages={-},pagecommand={},scale=0.95,offset=0mm 5mm]{MyPublishedArticle1.pdf}

%% NOTE 2
%% By using the package `pdfpages' to embed this pdf into the thesis, all the hyperlinks become no longer clickable.
%% To reinsert the links, the package `pax' can be used
%% Reinserting the links requires some manual work, and the `pax' is not flawless.
%% Follow the instructions in Thesis.tex, and be sure to test that it works.
