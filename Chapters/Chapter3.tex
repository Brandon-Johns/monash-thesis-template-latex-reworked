\section{The Title of My First Published Article}
List of Amendments to \cite{example3}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,beginpenalty=10000,first=\interlinepenalty10000]
	\item Equation 6 contains a typographical error, in which ${}^O\text{\textbf{p}}_i$ should be ${}^O\dot{\text{\textbf{p}}}_i$
\end{itemize}

%% The following embedded document represents your published article.
\includepdf[pages={-},pagecommand={},offset=\includepdfOffsetTwoside{} 10mm]{MyPublishedArticle1.pdf}

%% NOTE 1
%% The article is being embedded into an A4 document.
%% If the article is not A4, then it will be shrunk to fit and centred in the page.
%% \includepdf does not obey the document margins.
%% Scale and offset from the default position must be done manually
%% The arguments of offset are "offset=<horizontal offset> <vertical offset>"
%% e.g.
%% \includepdf[pages={-},pagecommand={},scale=0.95,offset=0mm 5mm]{MyPublishedArticle1.pdf}

%% Horizontal offset
%%    When using the option twoside, the margins are not symmetrical
%%    The command  "\includepdfOffsetTwoside{}" outputs the offset  to centre the pdf within the margins
%%    It automatically detects if twoside is enabled, and otherwise outputs an offset of "0mm"
%% Vertical offset
%%    If the thesis footer overlaps the included pdf, then you should change the scale and vertical offset

%% NOTE 2
%% By using the package `pdfpages' to embed this pdf into the thesis, all the hyperlinks become no longer clickable.
%% To reinsert the links, the package `pax' can be used
%% Reinserting the links requires some manual work, and the `pax' is not flawless.
%% Follow the instructions in Thesis.tex, and be sure to test that it works.
