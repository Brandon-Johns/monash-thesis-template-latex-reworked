\paragraph{My Subsubsubsection... WAIT WHAT!?}
If you get this deep, the command is not `subsubsubsection', but `paragraph'. Why?

For the record, I really suggest not to use this much depth unless you've really thought about your structure, and you are sure that it is the best way to do it.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subparagraph{My Subsubsubsubsection... rofl}
This is the maximum section depth that the titlesec package allows. May you never need it.
