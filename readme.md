# Monash University Thesis Template
This template is based on the version provided on the ENG Graduate Research Moodle (Downloaded in 2023).

Compliant with the Monash University requirements.

The complied PDF looks like [this](./Thesis.pdf).

Good for both
- Traditional thesis
- Thesis including published works.


## My Changes
I completely reworked the Thesis class and template.

Key changes
- Lightly restyled preliminary pages (Still compliant with Monash University requirements)
- Added support for subsubsection to subparagraph depth
- Updated to modern packages which give better control: vmargin->geometry, natbib->biblatex, etc.
- Restyled headings, footers, contents, line/paragraph spacing, float placement
- Disabled hyphenation
- Removed double-sided-page mode (sorry, but it's too complicated for me to bother with)
- Reorganised the files and added comments
- Made the output PDF/A-2u compliant (well, somewhat compliant: figures and maths are like ugh)
- Added ability to restore hyperlinks within the embedded pdfs. Not fully automatic- the user has to help it along
- Completely redid the example scaffolding and example content
